v1.0.0.16: Added exit if MFT record is old style NT record.

v1.0.0.15: Fixed bug when dumping timestamps and target was defined was indexnumber, that displayed timestamps of parent instead of target. Fixed bug when $MFT itself contained an $ATTRIBUTE_LIST. Fixed bug with handling records that was split across dataruns. Increased initialization size of array for runs and vcns which caused it to crash with extreme fragmentation.

v1.0.0.14: Added option to additionally read/write from/to shadow copies with new -shadow switch. Reading from shadow copies is done through both raw parsing and symblic link. Full support for writing to shadow copies. Added functionality to directly modify $INDEX_ROOT/$INDEX/ALLOCATION of parent. Implemented raw disk parsing for resolving all files, meaning any file can now be modified. Removed the touch of file through NtQueryInformationFile, as it's no longer needed. Fixed bug that caused dumped timestamps from shadow copies to be incorrect. Fixed bug that caused displayed offsets to be incorrect. Organized displayed output better and very differently to previous versions.

v1.0.0.13: Implemented fix for forcing Windows to synchronize the $STANDARD_INFORMATION timestamps to the ones indexed in the INDX of the parent. Added support for dumping timestamps from INDX in the parent.

v1.0.0.12: Added support for MFT record size of 4096 bytes. Added attempts at both methods of writing to physical disk. 

v1.0.0.11: Included signed drivers, so it also works with just TESTSIGNING on x64. 

v1.0.0.10: Implemented a kernel mode driver for writing modified MFT record back to disk.

v1.0.0.9: Added support for dumping timestamp information also from within shadow copies with the -d switch.

v1.0.0.8: Fixed mixup up of mapping for LastAccessTime, LastWriteTime and ChangeTime(MFT). Fixed bug in logic for lock/dismount handling of external drives and nt5.x vs nt6.x. Fixed a bug that caused only last $FILE_NAME timestamps to be displayed/written, instead of for all $FILE_NAME attributes.

v1.0.0.7: Re-written to only implement direct physical disk writing of timestamps. Fix for opening locked/protected files. Added support for unlimited amount of $FILE_NAME attributes to modify. Also now works faster.

v1.0.0.6: Lots of minor stuff changed, and in particular better feedback on console. New feature of allowing WriteFile() on PhysicalDisk.

v1.0.0.5: Complete support for dumping and writing of $FILE_NAME timestamps for both files and directories.

v1.0.0.4: Added support for directories.
