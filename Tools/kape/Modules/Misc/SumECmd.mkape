# .\KAPE\Targets\Windows\LogFiles.tkape will capture the SUM Database which is located at C:\Windows\System32\LogFiles\SUM
# This Module is meant to work in conjunction with the LogFiles.tkape acquiring the necessary files for SumECmd to parse in one fell swoop.
# When running this Module by itself, make sure your Module Source is pointed to the root of a drive or a folder path with structure similar to what is listed within the CommandLine above, if possible.
# You very well may need to manually add the drive letter in the command line for this Module to work properly. It all depends on where your source directory is pointed to.
# If that's not the case, then run the SumECmd tool by itself against your directory with a similar command as stated above or modify the path within the CommandLine of your local copy of this Module to make it fit your circumstances.
