# HOW TO PLACE THE BINARY
# 1. Download thor-lite using the link above. It's a free tool, but you must register for a license.
# 2. Unzip thor-lite.zip into '<KAPE_working_directory>/Modules'
# 3. Rename the unpacked 'thor-lite-win-pack' directory to 'thor-lite'
# 4. KAPE should now be able to find the executable in '<KAPE_working_directory>/Modules/thor-lite/thor64-lite.exe'
# 5. Be sure to include your '.lic' license file in the 'thor-lite'
#
# Currently configured to run "--quick" option which "selects the most relevant file paths only"
# Remove "--quick" for a full scan which will take much longer. (~2min versus 23min on test system)
