# HollowsHunter Scans all running processes. Recognizes and dumps a variety of potentially malicious implants (replaced/implanted PEs, shellcodes, hooks, in-memory patches).
# By default only replaced/implanted PEs are detected.
# In order for this module to work, place hollows_hunter.exe and pe-sieve.dll in the Modules/bin folder
# Expected Results:
# If replaced/implanted PEs are detected: The HollowsHunter folder will have the related process information (summary.json and report.json) as well as dump files
# Otherwise: No HollowsHunter folder will be created
