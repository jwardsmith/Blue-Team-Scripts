        Comment: "Locates NZBGet NZB files that were used by the user"

# Documentation
# C:\ProgramData\NZBGet\nzbget.log is where a verbose log file exists.
# C:\ProgramData\NZBGet\nzb\ is where a replication of any NZBs used by the user will reside, regardless of where the NZB was residing prior to its use. This behavior is similar to Newsbin Pro above.
