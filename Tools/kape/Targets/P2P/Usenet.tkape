# Documentation
# NZB files are the equivalent to .torrent in the Usenet world.
# NZB filenames usually are verbose and very clear in identifying what the user is downloading, i.e. MovieTitle.Year.Resolution.ReleaseType.Codec-ReleaseGroup.nzb.
# The same format is followed for music, apps, games, etc.
