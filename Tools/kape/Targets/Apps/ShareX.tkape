        Comment: "Locates and captures all files within the default ShareX folder path"

# Documentation
# ShareX is an amazing, free, and open-source alternative to Snipping Tool, Snagit, etc.
# By default, a user's captures are stored in the above location.
# The user can change their default folder path for screenshots by navigating to Application Settings -> Paths -> ShareX Personal Folder, hitting Apply, and restarting the program. Please note this target will be ineffective if the user changes the default folder path.
# C:\Users\%user%\Documents\ShareX\PersonalPath.cfg will list where the user currently saves all screenshots, application configuration files, backups, and logs, to name a few. This file should persist even after the user changes the default ShareX folder path.
# I changed the default folder location for where my screenshots, settings, etc were stored but C:\Users\%user%\Documents\ShareX\PersonalPath.cfg still existed and pointed to the location I moved everything over to.
# Screenshots folder will contain logical copies of all captures by the user typically separated by folder in YYYY-MM format with the logical files residing inside.
# Within the application's storage folder, there will be a Logs folder with files with a naming convention of ShareX-Log-YYYY-MM.txt. These files are important as they give a literal play-by-play of the user's actions with ShareX.
# This Target captures the contents of everything within the default folder path upon ShareX's installation. Modify the target as needed if. Contact me if you need help with that.
# UploadersConfig.json will have information regarding FTP/Cloud Storage accounts set up by the user.
