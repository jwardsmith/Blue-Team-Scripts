# Documentation
# Mattermost is very similar to Slack but differs mainly in that its a self-hosted, open-source alternative to Slack.
# Within the IndexedDB folder, there will be another folder that appears to be server-specific. I'm only in one server currently but this folder in particular was named after that server.
# Within this server-specific folder, there will be a .log file. Mine was named 000135.log. This is where you should concentrate your analysis.
# What is interesting about this file is that it appears to be a timestamped keylogger, of sorts. It appears that recent messages will be stored here (unknown exactly how far back) and timestamped by the keystroke.
# For example, for a message typed by the user: "hello", there would be 5 entries in this log (h, he, hel, hell, hello) with each entry being timestamped.
# This does not appear to be an exhaustive chat log, by any means. However, something is better than nothing and the timestamped keystrokes is certainly an interesting artifact.
