# VMware Workstation Pro stores a file named inventory.vmls which will provide file paths to Virtual Machines located on the user's system.
# Important evidence could be located within these Virtual Machines so this is great information to know.
# Preferences.ini will provide other file paths relating to the existing Virtual Machines on the user's system.
# Inventory.vmls can be viewed in any text editor and provides similar information to Preferences.ini.
