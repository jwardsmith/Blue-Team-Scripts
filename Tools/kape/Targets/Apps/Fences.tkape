# Documentation
# Fences is a great application for helping to organizes your desktop. It's very similar to Nimi Places.
# Fences takes a daily snapshot of the user's desktop.
# Fences also takes a PreInstallSnapshot and OnInstallSnapshot that can potentially be useful for the historical contents of a user's desktop.
# Please note, if the user has multiple monitors, it will grab the contents of all monitors into one .PNG file.
