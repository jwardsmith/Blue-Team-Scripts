# Documentation

# Microsoft Sticky Notes is a useful feature in Windows operating systems versions 7+. However, the notes are stored differently depending on the version of Windows.
# I have not yet tested the Stickynotes.snt for earlier versions of Windows. When I do, I will update this target with my results.
# For Windows 10 version 1607 and later, use your favorite SQL tool to view the .sqlite, .sqlite-wal and .sqlite-shm files. You will notice notes will be stored in the Note database.
# The SQLite database(s) this Target collects can be parsed with SQLECmd using the following map(s): https://github.com/EricZimmerman/SQLECmd/blob/master/SQLMap/Maps/Windows_MicrosoftStickyNotes_NotesDB.smap
