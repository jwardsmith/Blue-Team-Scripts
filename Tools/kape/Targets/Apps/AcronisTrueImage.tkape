# Documentation
# Acronis True Image can be used to create full, incremental, and differential backups of any disk/volume on a user's system.
# .\Acronis\TrueImageHome\Logs\ti_demon\ will contain logs that are prepended with ti_demon_ followed by what appears to be either a GUID or gibberish followed by a YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS timestamp prior to the .log file extension.
# Every time a backup process is started, a log file is created following this naming convention.
# .\Acronis\TrueImageHome\Database\ had a .opt file that I was able to view in a text editor that showed the source and destination for the backup job I created in my testing. It was nested under the "backup_archive_operation_options" with each being on a line that started with "volume_location".
# The Database folder target should get you the files I saw on my system that were relevant (Archives.db, Archives.db-shm, Archives.db-wal, Archives.db000000001h.opt).
# .\Acronis\TrueImageHome\Scripts\ contained .tib.tis files that were viewable in a text editor that appeared to have the contents of a batch script for running the backup I created in my testing.
