# Documentation
# XYplorer is a third-party Windows File Explorer replacement.
# By default, XYplorer has a left and right pane. Each pane will have it's own respective .ini file which displays the last 5 folders browsed as well as current tabs opened at the time of the program's exit.
# Within XYplorer.ini, [mruBrowse] will list the last 5 folders browsed. [mruGoto] will list the tabs that were opened at the time of the program's exit.
# Within each pane's pane.ini file, there will be a section labeled [History] where one can see the last 5 folders browsed, be default. It appears one can change the Count=X value where X is the amount of folders browsed that are recorded here.
# While using Everything by VoidTools, I observed the following files were modified upon the program's exit:
#  C:\Users\%user%\AppData\Roaming\XYplorer\lastini.dat
#  C:\Users\%user%\AppData\Roaming\XYplorer\action.dat
#  C:\Users\%user%\AppData\Roaming\XYplorer\tag.dat
#  C:\Users\%user%\AppData\Roaming\XYplorer\fvs.dat
#  C:\Users\%user%\AppData\Roaming\XYplorer\ks.dat
#  C:\Users\%user%\AppData\Roaming\XYplorer\udc.dat
#  C:\Users\%user%\AppData\Roaming\XYplorer\Catalogs\catalog.dat
#  C:\Users\%user%\AppData\Roaming\XYplorer\Panes\2\pane.ini
#  C:\Users\%user%\AppData\Roaming\XYplorer\Panes\1\pane.ini
#  C:\Users\%user%\AppData\Roaming\XYplorer\XYplorer.ini
# This means there might be something useful in each one of these files. The *.dat will grab all of those .dat files and the other targets will cover the .ini files.
