        Comment: "Locates the Clipboard history for AceText"

# Documentation
# AceText is made by the same people who make Edit Pad Pro, PowerGREP, etc. It's a cool program that serves as a Clipboard extension tool.
# From a forensic perspective, the entirety of a user's clipboard history is available for our perusal!
# Once you have the .atc file, you can open with any text editor and see the entire history of a user's clipboard contents.
# The copied text will be found between the <text> and </text> parameters.
# If content is copied from a webpage, copied text will be the same as above but there will also be a <url> and </url> parameter which will display the URL from which the contents were copied from.
# In addition to the above, the kind= parameter will provide clues as to where the contents were copied from.
