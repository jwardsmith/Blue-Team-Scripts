# Documentation
# Double Commander is a freeware Windows File Explorer replacement similar in function to Total Commander, which is commonly used by threat actors during IR incidents.
# If you open up the history.xml file path in a text editor, depending on how big the file is, all your artifacts equivalent to Shellbags should be located under a <Navigation> string with each "Shellbag" preprended by <Item>.
# It should be noted that these are sorted in descending order, meaning the top item is the most recent folder navigated to by the user.
# It should be noted that history.xml only updates when Double Commander is closed.
# For instance, I explored the following paths in this order from bottom to top:
#      <Item>C:\Users\%user%\Desktop\EZ Tools\TimelineExplorer\</Item>
#      <Item>C:\Users\%user%\Desktop\EZ Tools\TimelineExplorer\Settings\</Item>
#      <Item>C:\Users\%user%\Desktop\EZ Tools\TimelineExplorer\Layouts\</Item>
#      <Item>C:\Users\%user%\Desktop\EZ Tools\</Item>
#      <Item>C:\Users\%user%\Desktop\EZ Tools\SDBExplorer\</Item>
#      <Item>C:\Users\%user%\Desktop\EZ Tools\EZViewer\</Item>
#      <Item>C:\Users\%user%\Desktop\</Item>
#      <Item>C:\Users\%user%\</Item>
#      <Item>C:\Users\</Item>
#      <Item>C:\</Item>
#      <Item>C:\Program Files\</Item>
# Doublecmd.xml has a lot more information overall than history.xml, but it does have similar Shellbags-equivalent artifacts that are sorted in descending order.
# If you open up the doublecmd.xml file path in a text editor, search for the following string: <Path Filename= and you will start seeing these artifacts.
# For instance, besides the top two lines, I explored the following paths in this order from top to bottom:
# <Path Filename="bz2.dll">C:\Program Files\Double Commander\</Path>
# <Path Filename="Double Commander">C:\Program Files\</Path>
#       <Path Filename="Users">C:\</Path>
#       <Path Filename="%user%">C:\Users\</Path>
#       <Path Filename="Desktop">C:\Users\%user%\</Path>
#       <Path Filename="EZ Tools">C:\Users\%user%\Desktop\</Path>
#       <Path Filename="EZViewer">C:\Users\%user%\Desktop\EZ Tools\</Path>
#       <Path Filename="..">C:\Users\%user%\Desktop\EZ Tools\EZViewer\</Path>
#       <Path Filename="SDBExplorer">C:\Users\%user%\Desktop\EZ Tools\</Path>
#       <Path Filename="..">C:\Users\%user%\Desktop\EZ Tools\SDBExplorer\</Path>
#       <Path Filename="TimelineExplorer">C:\Users\%user%\Desktop\EZ Tools\</Path>
#       <Path Filename="Layouts">C:\Users\%user%\Desktop\EZ Tools\TimelineExplorer\</Path>
#       <Path Filename="..">C:\Users\%user%\Desktop\EZ Tools\TimelineExplorer\Layouts\</Path>
#       <Path Filename="Settings">C:\Users\%user%\Desktop\EZ Tools\TimelineExplorer\</Path>
#       <Path Filename="..">C:\Users\%user%\Desktop\EZ Tools\TimelineExplorer\Settings\</Path>
#       <Path Filename="Settings">C:\Users\%user%\Desktop\EZ Tools\TimelineExplorer\</Path>
# These artifacts can be very useful when your threat actor isn't using File Explorer.
