# Documentation
# Snagit is an awesome, premium screen capturing software that is totally worth looking into.
# Captures with Snagit are stored as .SNAG files, which can be opened with Snagit Editor.
# Think of Snagit as Snipping Tool on steroids. The user can create robust diagrams and guides on top of the captured image.
# This target will grab all the contents of the DataStore folder.
