# Documentation
# Directory Opus is the best Windows File Explorer replacement on the market, in my humble opinion.
# Thankfully, lots of data is stored on user activity if your suspect ends up using this as their daily driver.
# Any of the .osd files can be viewed in your favorite text editor.
# The Thumbnail Cache folder will dump all files which appear to be randomized filenames with a .db extension.
