# Documentation

# In the above link, search for SessionData to warp to the applicable information you can find for what documents the user had opened within SumatraPDF at the last time of program exit
# I've had 170+ PDFs opened at once with SumatraPDF and each of their full file paths were recorded within this file. Very useful!
