Process Hacker is a powerful free and open source process viewer.

== Getting started ==

Simply run ProcessHacker.exe to start Process Hacker. There are two 
versions, 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64). If you are not sure which 
version to use, open Control Panel > System and check the "System 
type". You cannot run the 32-bit version of Process Hacker on a 
64-bit system and expect it to work correctly, unlike other programs.

== System requirements ==

Windows XP SP2 or higher, 32-bit or 64-bit.

== Plugins ==

To use plugins, follow these steps:

1. Create a directory called "plugins" in the same directory as 
   ProcessHacker.exe.
2. Copy the plugin DLL files into the "plugins" directory.
3. Open Process Hacker and make sure "Enable plugins" in Options 
   is ticked.
4. Restart Process Hacker if necessary.

Plugins can be configured from Hacker > Plugins.
