# Things To Do

- Ensure SIEM is getting all the right logs (what are we currently sending, what is the purpose of it, do we still need it, and what are we missing)
- Collate logs into once place ideally SIEM
- Create alerts (use threat intel reports on APT's, and use MITRE ATT&CK coverage)
- Create SOC dashboards
- Build a sandbox
- Create documentation (playbooks/SOPs/templates)
