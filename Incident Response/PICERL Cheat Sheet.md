# PICERL Cheat Sheet

*The term “incident” refers to actions that result in harm or the significant threat of harm to your computer systems or data.* An “event” is any observable occurrence in a system and/or network.*

### Preparation

*Get the team ready to handle incidents.*

- People - are our people trained, and tested?
- Policy - do we have warning banners that explicitly define our organisation’s policy on the presumption of privacy, do we have an approach to incident handling (contain and clear, or watch and learn), and do we have a policy for outside "peer" notification?
- Management Support - do we have management support for an incident handling capability?
- Building a Team - do we have qualified people on the team?
- Checklists & Team Issues - do we have system build checklists for backing up and rebuilding, and do we have a compensation plan for the team?
- Team Organisation - do we have a solid team structure?
- Emergency Comm Plan - do we have an emergency communications plan, and a call list?
- Access to Systems & Data - do we have controlled access to systems and data?
- Point of Contact & Resources - do we have a primary point of contact,an incident command communications centre, and resource acquisition plans for the team?
- Reporting Facilities - do we have a way user's can report abnormal activity to us (phone hotline, email, intranet website)?
- Train the Team - are our incident responders trained (tools/techniques training)?
- Cultivate Relationships - do we have good relationships with our service desk and system admin/network admin employees?
- Jump Bag - do we have a jump bag stocked with fresh media for storing system images (CDs/USBs/HDDs)?
- Processes - do we have playbooks/SOPs/templates?
- Technology - do we have security tooling e.g. SIEM/EDR/Proxy, do we have binary image-creation software e.g. dd, Netcat, ncat, or Safeback, do we have forensic software e.g. Sleuth Kit, Autopsy, EnCase, Forensics Toolkit (FTK), or X-Ways Forensics, do we have diagnosis software we can trust, and do we have investigative tools e.g. SANS SIFT VM?

### Identification

*The bulk of all detects will come from either sensor platforms or the things people just happen to notice. Can occur at the network perimeter (external-facing NIDS/NIPS), host perimeter (personal FW/HIDS/HIPS), system-level (AV/EDR/FIM), or application-level (web app, cloud service). https://zeltser.com/security-incident-questionnaire-cheat-sheet/.*

- Assigning Handlers - do we have a primary incident handler?
