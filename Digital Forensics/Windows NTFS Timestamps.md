# Windows NTFS Timestamps

Unless you have a very specific reason to do otherwise, we recommend primarily focusing on the modified (M) and created (B) times in your investigation.

**M - Data Content Change Time:**
- Time the data content of a file was last modified.

**A - Last Access Time:**
- Approximate time when the file data was last accessed.

**C - Metadata Change Time:**
- Time this MFT record was last modified e.g. file is renamed, fize size changes, security permissions update, file ownership is changed.

**B - File Creation Time:**
- Time file was created in the volume.
