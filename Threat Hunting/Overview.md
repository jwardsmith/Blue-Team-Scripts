# Overview

Threat hunting is a proactive approach, rather than reactive. It is the assumption that we are already compromised, but just do not know about it yet.

Threat hunting is the name for any manual or machine-assisted process for finding security incidents that your automated detection systems missed.

The key here is that even though we often use computers, automation, and machine learning techniques to help us identify and filter events of interest, hunting is always driven by a human. Our curiosity, imagination and ability to deduce patterns of malicious activity even when we have never encountered them before are simply beyond the capabilities of today’s technology.

One of the chief goals of hunting should be to improve your automated detection capabilities by prototyping new ways to detect malicious activity and turning those prototypes into production detection capabilities.

There are three factors to consider when judging an organisation's hunting ability: the quality of the data they collect for hunting, the tools they provide to access and analyse the data, and the skills of the analysts who actually use the data and the tools to find security incidents.

Don’t think of hunting as a way to find more security incidents using expensive humans. Instead, think about threat hunting as a way to improve your automated detections over time. When a hunter figures out a new way to detect malicious behavior, the goal is to also figure out how to automate that detection. That way, the next time malicious activity will be alerted and responded to quickly. 

The creation of new security incidents during the hunting process is actually a secondary benefit, more as a by-product of the hunt, not its intended purpose.
