# Type Of Hunts

### Hypothesis-Driven Hunts

This is the classic approach, where hunters form a supposition about potential threats and their activities that may be present on the organization’s network, then use data and analysis to confirm or deny their suspicions.

### Baseline Hunts

In this type of hunt, hunters establish a baseline of “normal” behavior and then search for deviations that could signal malicious activity.

### Model-Assisted Threat Hunts (M-ATH)

M-ATH hunts could be accurately described as "Sherlock Holmes meets artificial intelligence." Hunters use machine learning (ML) techniques to create models of known good or known malicious behavior and look for activity that deviates from or aligns with these models. Think of this as almost like a hybrid of the hypothesis-driven and baseline types, but with substantial automation from the ML.
