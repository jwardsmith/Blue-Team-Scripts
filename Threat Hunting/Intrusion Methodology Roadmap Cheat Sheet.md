# Intrusion Methodology Roadmap Cheat Sheet

### Threat Hunting & Assessment

Use tools that can scale collection and analysis, focusing on occurrence stacking and outlier analysis. Use broad scoping techniques.

### Triage Collection & Analysis

Perform targeted triage collection on systems of interest to acquire a deeper understanding of attacker activity. Triage data can include traditional forensic artifacts like application execution data, file system information, and in-memory artifacts such as process trees.

### Deep-Dive Forensics

Reserve our limited time for performing deep-dive forensics on only a handful of systems having the best chance to help us understand attacker tools and tradecraft and craft better indicators to assist with scoping additional compromised systems.
