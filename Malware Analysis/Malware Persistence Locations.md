# Malware Persistence Locations

### AutoStart Location

*Also known as AutoStart Extension Points (ASEPs). By far, the most popular ASEPs on the planet are the "run" Registry keys. Excellent starting place to look for malicious activity on a system. Only a fraction of possible locations are below.*

**Executed when a user logs on:**
- NTUSER.DAT\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
- NTUSER.DAT\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Runonce
- SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Runonce
- SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\policies\Explorer\Run
- SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

**Executed at boot:**
- SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Userinit

**Startup Folder (shortcut files) (does not require local admin) - Executed when a user logs on:**
- %AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup

### Service Creation/Replacement/Recovery

*Designed to run applications in the background without user interaction. Many services are required at system boot. Services can be standalone executables or loaded as DLLs. Service configurations, as well as device driver configurations, are stored in the Registry under HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services. The keys here provide the paramters for each service, including the service name, display name, path to the service's executable image file, the start value, required privileges, dependencies, and more. Each service has a start type value configured to start at boot, by manual intervention, or on trigger events such as obtaining an IP address or hardware device connections. Start values of 0x02 (Automatic) and 0x00 (Boot start of a device driver) can provide persistence for malicious code.*

**New Service Creation:**
- Start value of 0x02 will start automatically.

**Service Replacement:**
- Modify and autostart a service to load new binary. Finds a current service that is disabled or unneeded and replaces the existing binary with a malicious one.

**Service Failure Recovery:**
- Load a malicious binary when a specific service crashes. Check service properties -> Recovery -> First failure = Run a Program.

### Scheduled Tasks

*Provide an extremely granular means to create persistence. The command at.exe is deprecated but still used, while schtasks.exe is the upgraded version of at.exe. Task information is stored in C:\Windows\Tasks or C:\Windows\System32\Tasks. Tasks can be set for specific Windows events such as when a specific userf logs on. Both at.exe and schtasks.exe can schedule tasks on remote systems. Most forensics artifacts for these remote tasks will be present on the systems they were executed on, not the originating system.*

**at.exe:**
- Deprecated, but still present in WinXP and Win7+.
- Use recorded in at*.job files and Schdlgu.txt (WinXP).

**schtasks.exe:**
- Activity logged in Task Scheduler and Security logs.

### DLL Hijacking

**DLL Search Order Hijacking:**
- Place malicious file ahead of DLL in search order.

**Phantom DLL Hijacking:**
- Find DLLs that applications attempt to load, but either don't exist or can be replaced.

**DLL Side-Loading:**
- WinSxS mechanism provides a new version of a legit DLL.

**Relative Path DLL Hijacking:**
- Copy susceptible.exe and corresponding bad.dll to location of choice.

### WMI Event Consumers

### More Advanced - Local Group Policy, MS Office Add-In, or BIOS Flashing
